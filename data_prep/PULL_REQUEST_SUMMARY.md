- Converts geographic coordinates to image pixel coordinates
- Overlays ground truth annotations on downloaded imagery
- Visual comparison between predictions and actual tree locations

### ✅ Comprehensive Reporting
- Generates detailed markdown reports
- Includes server status, response times, and error messages
- Provides specific recommendations for each data source
- Summary statistics and executive overview

### ✅ Visualization Capabilities
- Creates side-by-side comparisons of original imagery, predictions, and ground truth
- Exports high-resolution PNG visualizations
- Color-coded bounding boxes (red for predictions, blue for ground truth)
- Saves individual images and comparison plots

## Testing Results

During development, the system was tested against multiple image servers:

| Server | Status | Response Time | Result |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Calgary** | ✅ Functional | 0.22s | Successfully downloaded 2024 orthophoto imagery at 10cm resolution |
| **Charlottesville** | ❌ DNS Error | N/A | Server appears to be down or relocated |
| **New York State** | ✅ Functional | N/A | Latest orthoimagery service (2021-2024) |
| **Washington DC** | ✅ Functional | N/A | 2023 orthophoto at 6-inch resolution |

## Usage Examples

### Quick Server Test (No Dependencies)
```bash
cd data_prep
python test_image_sources_lite.py --max_sources 2 --timeout 15
```

### Full Testing with Tree Detection
```bash
# Install dependencies first
pip install deepforest requests rasterio geopandas pandas matplotlib

# Run full test
python test_image_sources.py --max_sources 5 --output_dir results
```

### Add New Image Server
Edit `image_server_config.json`:
```json
{
  "image_servers": {
    "your_city": {
      "name": "Your City Name",
      "url": "https://your-server.com/arcgis/rest/services/...",
      "type": "arcgis_imageserver",
      "test_bbox": [-long_min, lat_min, -long_max, lat_max],
      "resolution": 0.3
    }
  }
}
```

## Recommendations Implemented

- Moved from hardcoded configurations to JSON files
- Easy to add new servers without code changes
- Version control for server configurations

### 2. ✅ Multiple Protocol Support
- ArcGIS ImageServer and MapServer
- Web Map Service (WMS) support
- Extensible architecture for additional protocols

### 3. ✅ Error Handling and Retry Logic
- Comprehensive exception handling
- Timeout management for slow servers
- Detailed error reporting and recommendations

### 4. ✅ Ground Truth Integration

- Quality assessment metrics

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### 1. Caching System
```python
def get_cached_image(bbox, server_config, cache_dir="cache"):
    bbox_hash = hashlib.md5(str(bbox).encode()).hexdigest()
    cache_file = Path(cache_dir) / f"{server_config['name']}_{bbox_hash}.png"
    return cache_file if cache_file.exists() else None
```

### 2. Parallel Processing
```python
async def test_servers_parallel(server_configs):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [test_server_async(session, name, config) 
                for name, config in server_configs.items()]
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### 3. Web Dashboard
- Real-time server status monitoring
- Interactive visualization of test results
- Automated health checks and alerting

### 4. Advanced Tree Detection
- Custom model training for specific regions
- Integration with other tree detection algorithms
- Confidence score analysis and filtering
